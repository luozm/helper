I am a Professor at the School of Information Sciences (iSchool) , the University of Pittsburgh. I also have academic affiliation with the Intelligent Systems Program, an interdisciplinary academic unit focusing on research and education on Artificial Intelligence. I am the director of a research lab called Information Retrieval, Integration and Synthesis. I was the chair of SIS Council, the governing body for the iSchool, between 2012 and 2014. I currently serve on the editorial board of SCI/SSCI indexed journals “Information Processing and Management”, “Internet Research” and “Aslib Journal of Information Management”.
