I am a 4th year Ph.D. student at School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh, and a member of Information Retrieval, Integration and Synthesis Lab, which is led by my advisor Prof. Daqing He. I also work with Dr. Leanne Bowler from Pratt Institute, and Dr. Tingting Jiang from Wuhan University.
