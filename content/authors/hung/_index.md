I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Department of Informatics and Networked Systems, School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh. I received my Master and Bachelor degrees from Department of Computer Science, University of Information Technology, VNU-HCM, Vietnam. I am very interested in and passionate about applying Machine Learning to human learning, Text Mining in Education, Educational Data Mining, Semantic Information Retrieval, and Personalized Recommendation. I am working at [the Personalized Adaptive Web Systems Lab (PAWS)](http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/wiki/Main_Page). My advisor is Dr. Peter Brusilovsky. Currently, I have been taking part in the project Open Corpus Personalized Learning. I have also been working with and being mentored by Dr. Zach Pardos since Spring 2018.
