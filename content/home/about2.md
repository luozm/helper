As the Internet has become a prominent source of health information to guide patients’ decision-making and self-management activities, patients strongly indicate they need navigational support to locate appropriate information on the Internet. The overall goal of our project is to build and implement a **“Health E-Librarian with Personalized Recommendations (HELPeR)”**, a personalized digital librarian that provides individualized, reliable online information relevant to the patient’s needs, interest and knowledge across the disease trajectory. As a first step, we are now looking for participants who can help us to better understand the information needs and preferences of women with ovarian cancer and their family members.
