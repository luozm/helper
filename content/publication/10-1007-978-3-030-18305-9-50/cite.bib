 abstract = {Social media is an important source to learn the concerns and needs of patients and caregivers in home care settings. However, manually identifying their needs can be labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we address the problem of need detection, automatically identifying patient needs in text. We explore both neural and traditional machine learning approaches, and evaluate them on a newly annotated dataset in an ovarian cancer discussion forum. We discuss issues and challenges of this novel task.},
